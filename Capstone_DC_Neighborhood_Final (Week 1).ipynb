Wei is interested in living in a DC neighborhood and explores the DC museums and city activities.  Wei is an avid bike rider, loves cooking and enjoys a variety of cuisines. Wei will not have a car in the first several months and will rely on Uber or public transportation for the most part.  In this data science project, I will try to provide insights about the DC neighborhoods which will help her to narrow down the neighborhood(s) for considerations.\n\nI will use the data science tool to generate several more suitable DC neighborhoods based on the above criteria. I will use analysis to shed light on the pros and cons of each area so that she can choose the most ideal neighborshood.  Other people who may be interested in this project could be people who look to move to the DC area in general."
